        <li>Understand how to design organizations such as NSF Large Facilities (LFs) to be resilient to future crises
            and major disasters.
        </li>
        <li>Inform future cyberinfrastructure innovations that can support the LFs’ science missions during major

        The COVID-19 global pandemic in 2020 has created major disruptions to the research enterprise.
        NSF-supported large facilities are critical elements of US research infrastructure and are increasingly
        dependent on advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) comprising advanced computing, data and software assets,
        networking, and the related specialized workforce to accomplish their science missions. This study investigates
        how large facilities are impacted by, and are responding to, the pandemic challenge with a focus on
        understanding factors related to the use of existing CI. This project will also explore the value of CI in the
        broader social context of how people and the facilities perceive and respond to major disruptive events. The
        goal is to determine how to design large facility organizations to be more resilient during crises and major
        disasters and what CI capabilities are needed to support these and other large science projects to accomplish
        their science missions during such disruptions.

        This study comprises three main research questions related to NSF large facilities and CI during the pandemic:
        (a) What types of research activities remain "business as usual" and what types of activities must adapt or stop
        completely under pandemic conditions (b) If facilities could turn back time, what would they have done to better
        prepare, dnd (c) What lessons are facilities learning from the current disruptions, and how can these be best
        disseminated to the facility, CI, and research communities? The approach is grounded in Weick's Theory of
        Organizing, and examines disruptions from the environment (ecological change) through the stages of enactment
        (immediate actions), selection (rules establishment), and retention (identification of approaches worth
        re-utilizing in future events), with feedback loops linking the stages and the environment. The project's goals
        will be accomplished primarily through interviews with domain scientists, CI users, developers, and
        administrators who are engaged in NSF large facility science and operations. The project will also analyze and
        document the organizational structures of the facilities to identify the key engagement points with national CI
        resources and services, towards enhancing the ability of the broader CI community to engage with the facilities.
        The ultimate objective of this project is to provide a framework for facilities and other large science projects
        to mitigate disruptions to their scientific and operational activities in current and future times of crisis.
        Study outcomes and findings will be widely disseminated to the stakeholder communities.
